For instance, which time of the day users should do a heavy work out such as running, tabada, outdoor bike rides,etc... or users can do yoga in a certain time of the day to get better sleep, improve heart rate. \n3. Since BMI used to measure overweight and obesity, users can adjust their weight to get healthier or lose weight. Our product can have some features to either recommend some healthy meals with low calories/carbs. \n4. With the heartrate tracker, users are not only being able to monitor their quality of sleep but also adjust their time of exercise to recovery heart rate, then create a better routine of exercise over time. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Thank you for your time!
